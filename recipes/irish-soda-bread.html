    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>St. Patrick's Day is right around the corner, and what better way to celebrate than with a loaf or two of Irish soda bread? If made correctly, this is one of the best quick breads (those leavened without yeast) you'll ever have. Subtly sweet, with a light, tender crumb, and not at all dry. You can use quick-cooking oats in place of rolled oats, if desired.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons grated orange zest</li>
        <li>1 cup dried currants</li>
        <li>⅓ cup golden raisins</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.</li>
        <li>Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, oats, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture using a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal.</li>
        <li>Beat buttermilk, egg, honey, and orange zest together in a bowl. Pour buttermilk mixture, currants, and raisins into flour mixture; stir with a wooden spoon until a wet, sticky dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a well-floured work surface; press dough together into a soft ball of dough and cut into 2 pieces. Form each half into a smooth, round loaf. Transfer to prepared baking sheet and let rest for 15 minutes. Cut a 1/2-inch deep "X" into the top of each loaf with a serrated knife.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and fragrant, about 45 minutes. Transfer loaves to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
