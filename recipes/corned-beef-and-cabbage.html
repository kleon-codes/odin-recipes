    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's almost St. Patrick's Day, and for many that means boiling up a nice authentic Irish dinner of corned beef and cabbage. The original Irish recipe actually used a type of lean bacon, made with a cut of pork similar to Canadian bacon. Corned beef came into the picture as a lower-cost substitution, to replace the more expensive and harder to find cut.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) corned beef brisket with spice packet</li>
        <li>3 quarts water</li>
        <li>1 onion, quartered</li>
        <li>3 carrots, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>3 stalks celery, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 pounds red potatoes, halved</li>
        <li>1 small head cabbage, cut into eighths</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine corned beef and spice packet contents, water, onion, carrots, celery, and salt together in a large pot or Dutch oven; bring to a simmer, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot, reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat is almost fork-tender, about 3 hours. Add potatoes and simmer, uncovered, until potatoes are almost tender, about 30 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Place cabbage pieces on top of and around meat, cover the pot, and simmer until cabbage is tender, 20 to 30 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Remove meat to a cutting board and let rest 10 to 15 minutes. Cut across the grain and serve in a bowl; ladle vegetables and broth over the top.</li>
    </ol>
